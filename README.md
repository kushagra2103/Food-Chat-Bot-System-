# Food-Chat-Bot-System-

## Purpose of the Project 

Here I had developed a chatbot that will tell you top 5 cafes/ restros for a particular cuisine and location. It is based on RASA framework. The model uses ZOMATO API for results and is deployed on SLACK platform. 


## Problem Statement

Create a basic chatbot that:

Can search for places to eat.

Get info like cuisines, address etc.

Support small talk (chit-chat) with the user.

Remember some context of the conversation.

Take feedback and start again if needed.
